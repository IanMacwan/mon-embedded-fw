# Bare-Metal ARM Cortex-M Firmware (QEMU)

This project is a minimal, educational bare-metal firmware built for an ARM Cortex-M microcontroller and run entirely in QEMU. It demonstrates how a system boots and operates without an operating system, using custom startup code, a linker script, memory-mapped peripherals, and interrupts.
